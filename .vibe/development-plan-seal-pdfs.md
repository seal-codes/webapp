## Current Status: ðŸŽ‰ PDF UX Successfully Adapted to Match Image Sealing!

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: PDF sealing now has the same intuitive interface as image sealing!

### âœ… Completed Features:
- **PDF Preview & Rendering**: Fully working with proper canvas display
- **Consistent UX**: PDF sealing now matches image sealing experience exactly
- **Direct Drag-and-Drop**: Users can drag QR codes directly on PDF canvas
- **Floating Size Controls**: +/- buttons appear near QR code (like image sealing)
- **Touch Support**: Works on mobile devices
- **Visual Feedback**: Proper cursor states and hover effects

### ðŸŽ¯ UX Consistency Achieved:
- **Image Sealing**: Canvas + drag QR + floating +/- buttons
- **PDF Sealing**: Canvas + drag QR + floating +/- buttons âœ…

## Remaining Tasks:
1. **Multi-page PDF Support**: Add page selector for PDFs with multiple pages
2. **Complete Sealing Workflow**: Test and fix the full sealing process
3. **Sealed Document Display**: Ensure sealed PDFs are properly shown
4. **QR Code Quality**: Verify QR codes render correctly in final sealed PDFs

## Next Priority: 
Test the complete PDF sealing workflow and ensure the sealed document is properly generated and displayed.
