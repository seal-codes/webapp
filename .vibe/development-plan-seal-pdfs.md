- [x] Clean up debugging code
- [ ] Implement proper PDF page selector component (for multi-page PDFs)
- [ ] Enhance QR Code positioning component for PDFs (reuse QRSealRenderer, CanvasPreview from images)
- [ ] Fix sealed document display (currently not shown)
- [ ] Fix QR code distortion in sealed PDFs
- [ ] Update verification UI for PDF-specific features
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create unit tests for PDF services

## Current Status: ✅ PDF Preview and Basic Sealing Working!

**Major Breakthrough**: PDF preview functionality is now fully working! Users can upload PDFs and see the actual document content with QR positioning controls.

## Remaining Issues:
1. **Multi-page PDF Support**: Need proper page selector for PDFs with multiple pages
2. **Enhanced QR Positioning**: Should reuse advanced QR positioning components from image sealing
3. **Sealed Document Display**: Sealed document is not shown after sealing process
4. **QR Code Quality**: QR code may be distorted in final sealed PDFs

## Next Priority: 
Focus on enhancing the QR positioning experience and testing the full sealing workflow.
