# Development Plan: seal.codes-2 (hackathon branch)

*Generated on 2025-06-27 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Adapt the seal.codes project for participation in the World's Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt. The project must be built primarily with Bolt.new and comply with all hackathon requirements including mandatory Bolt.new usage, badge integration, and submission requirements.

## Hackathon Requirements Summary
- **Primary Development**: Must be built primarily with Bolt.new
- **Badge Requirement**: Must include visible "Built on Bolt" badge linking to https://bolt.new/
- **Submission Period**: May 30, 2025 - June 30, 2025
- **Project URL**: Must provide Bolt.new project URL (https://bolt.new/~/...)
- **Functionality**: Must be fully functional and demonstrate meaningful use of Bolt's capabilities
- **External Tools**: Limited use allowed for areas where Bolt is less suited (minimal and documented)

## Key Decisions
- **Focus**: Create `/hackathon` route to showcase bolt.new's contributions to the project
- **Strategy**: Emphasize bolt.new as the foundation builder, manual commits as polish/tuning
- **Narrative**: "Bolt.new made this project possible - we just refined what it created"
- **Evidence**: Use commit history to demonstrate bolt.new's impact vs manual tweaks
- **Dual Approach**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) + Development Timeline
- **Transparency**: Judges can execute analysis scripts to verify all metrics
- **Nerd Appeal**: "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals
- **Architecture**: JSON-based scripts for machine-readable data, verify script for interpretation
- **Visual Design**: Terminal file tree (SBOM) + Git graph visualization (Timeline)
- **Implementation Strategy**: Build components separately first, add cross-highlighting later
- **Future Evolution**: DNA helix visualization as advanced enhancement

- **Professional separation** of data extraction vs interpretation

### Design Direction
- "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals
- Target developer judges with technical depth
- Emphasize the 81% core architecture statistic as the hero metric
- Show bolt.new as the foundation, manual work as polish
- **Dual Component Architecture**:
  1. **SBOM Component**: Interactive file tree with bolt.new session attribution
  2. **Timeline Component**: Session-by-session progression from zero to production
