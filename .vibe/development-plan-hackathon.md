# Development Plan: seal.codes-2 (hackathon branch)

*Generated on 2025-06-27 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Adapt the seal.codes project for participation in the World's Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt. The project must be built primarily with Bolt.new and comply with all hackathon requirements including mandatory Bolt.new usage, badge integration, and submission requirements.

## Hackathon Requirements Summary
- **Primary Development**: Must be built primarily with Bolt.new
- **Badge Requirement**: Must include visible "Built on Bolt" badge linking to https://bolt.new/
- **Submission Period**: May 30, 2025 - June 30, 2025
- **Project URL**: Must provide Bolt.new project URL (https://bolt.new/~/...)
- **Functionality**: Must be fully functional and demonstrate meaningful use of Bolt's capabilities
- **External Tools**: Limited use allowed for areas where Bolt is less suited (minimal and documented)

### Technical Architecture

#### **Component Hierarchy**
```
HackathonPage.vue
├── HackathonHero.vue
├── ArchitecturalDNA.vue
│   ├── SessionCategory.vue
│   ├── FileTree.vue
│   └── CoverageMetrics.vue
├── DevelopmentTimeline.vue

    ├── JSONViewer.vue
    └── DataExporter.vue
```

#### **Data Flow**
1. **Page Load** → Fetch cached analysis data or trigger fresh analysis
2. **User Interaction** → Update component state and trigger re-analysis if needed
3. **Script Execution** → Stream results to UI components in real-time
4. **Data Updates** → Reactive updates across all visualization components

## Key Decisions
- **Focus**: Create `/hackathon` route to showcase bolt.new's contributions to the project
- **Strategy**: Emphasize bolt.new as the foundation builder, manual commits as polish/tuning
- **Narrative**: "Bolt.new made this project possible - we just refined what it created"
- **Evidence**: Use commit history to demonstrate bolt.new's impact vs manual tweaks
- **Dual Approach**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) + Development Timeline
- **Transparency**: Judges can execute analysis scripts to verify all metrics
- **Nerd Appeal**: "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals
- **Architecture**: JSON-based scripts for machine-readable data, verify script for interpretation

## Notes
## Notes
### Extracted Metrics (COMPREHENSIVE & VERIFIED!)

- **12% manual enhancements** (1,073 lines - FAQ system, refinements)
- **81% codebase coverage** (9,360/11,546 total lines)
- **82% file coverage** (57/69 files)

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- **Foundation Architecture**: 2,513 lines (Session 1 - app structure, routing, state)
- **Verification System**: 3,995 lines (Session 2 - QR scanning, document verification)
- **Authentication & Backend**: 1,332 lines (Session 3 - OAuth, services, backend)
- **Signature Verification**: 202 lines (Session 4 - security layer)
- **UI Polishing**: 245 lines (Session 5 - visual enhancements)
- **Manual additions**: 1,073 lines (FAQ system, additional components)

### The "Zero to Something" Story (Verified)
- Bolt.new provided **comprehensive architectural foundation** (88% of analyzed code)
- Manual work focused on **user experience enhancements** (12%)
- **High coverage analysis** ensures credible representation (81% of codebase)
- Perfect example of bolt.new's superpower: **rapid architecture creation**

### JSON Architecture Benefits
- **Machine-readable data** for web interface consumption
- **Verifiable metrics** - judges can inspect raw data separately
- **Extensible foundation** - can enhance with detailed file-level data later
- **Professional separation** of data extraction vs interpretation

### Design Direction
- "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals
- Target developer judges with technical depth
- Emphasize the 81% core architecture statistic as the hero metric
- Show bolt.new as the foundation, manual work as polish
- **Dual Component Architecture**:
  1. **SBOM Component**: Interactive file tree with bolt.new session attribution
  2. **Timeline Component**: Session-by-session progression from zero to production
- **Executable Verification**: Judges can run analysis scripts to verify metrics
- **Transparency**: All calculations are reproducible and verifiable
