# Development Plan: seal.codes-2 (hackathon branch)

*Generated on 2025-06-27 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Adapt the seal.codes project for participation in the World's Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt. The project must be built primarily with Bolt.new and comply with all hackathon requirements including mandatory Bolt.new usage, badge integration, and submission requirements.

## Hackathon Requirements Summary
- **Primary Development**: Must be built primarily with Bolt.new
- **Badge Requirement**: Must include visible "Built on Bolt" badge linking to https://bolt.new/
- **Submission Period**: May 30, 2025 - June 30, 2025
- **Project URL**: Must provide Bolt.new project URL (https://bolt.new/~/...)
- **Functionality**: Must be fully functional and demonstrate meaningful use of Bolt's capabilities
- **External Tools**: Limited use allowed for areas where Bolt is less suited (minimal and documented)

## Explore
### Tasks
- [x] Research Bolt.new capabilities and limitations for seal.codes features
- [x] Evaluate which seal.codes features can be implemented in Bolt.new  
- [x] Define minimum viable product (MVP) scope for hackathon
- [x] Design /hackathon route layout and user experience
- [x] Plan commit history visualization approach
- [x] Define metrics to showcase bolt.new's impact
- [x] Create comprehensive analysis suite for judges
- [x] Develop SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) approach for code attribution
- [x] Build development timeline analysis for process demonstration
- [x] Implement transparent, verifiable metrics calculation
- [ ] Design interactive UI components for both SBOM and timeline views
- [ ] Plan executable script integration in the web interface
- [ ] Consider responsive layout for the hackathon showcase

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Read and analyzed hackathon rules and requirements
- [x] Identified key constraints and mandatory requirements
- [x] Analyzed commit history to identify bolt.new vs manual contributions
- [x] Defined strategy: showcase development process via /hackathon route
- [x] Confirmed project already has bolt.new badge and compliance

## Plan

- [ ] Project runs entirely within Bolt environment
- [ ] Basic testing is complete
- [ ] Project meets hackathon requirements

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed

## Key Decisions
- **Focus**: Create `/hackathon` route to showcase bolt.new's contributions to the project
- **Strategy**: Emphasize bolt.new as the foundation builder, manual commits as polish/tuning
- **Narrative**: "Bolt.new made this project possible - we just refined what it created"
- **Evidence**: Use commit history to demonstrate bolt.new's impact vs manual tweaks
- **Dual Approach**: SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) + Development Timeline
- **Transparency**: Judges can execute analysis scripts to verify all metrics
- **Nerd Appeal**: "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals

## Notes
### Extracted Metrics (REFINED & ACCURATE!)
- **81% core architecture from bolt.new** (4,189/5,148 lines analyzed)
- **19% manual enhancements** (959 lines - FAQ, polish, refinements)
- **Foundation Architecture**: 2,259 lines (Session 1 - app structure, routing, state)
- **Verification System**: 1,228 lines (Session 2 - QR scanning, document verification)
- **Authentication System**: 702 lines (Session 3 - OAuth, user management)
- **Manual additions**: FAQ system, UI polish, bug fixes, refactoring

### The "Zero to Something" Story
- Bolt.new provided the **architectural foundation** that everything builds upon
- Manual work focused on **enhancements and user experience**
- Refactored components still carry bolt.new's "architectural DNA"
- Perfect example of bolt.new's superpower: **rapid prototyping to production-ready**

### Design Direction
- "As nerdy and interactive as possible" with stunning visuals
- Target developer judges with technical depth
- Emphasize the 81% core architecture statistic as the hero metric
- Show bolt.new as the foundation, manual work as polish
- **Dual Component Architecture**:
  1. **SBOM Component**: Interactive file tree with bolt.new session attribution
  2. **Timeline Component**: Session-by-session progression from zero to production
- **Executable Verification**: Judges can run analysis scripts to verify metrics
- **Transparency**: All calculations are reproducible and verifiable
